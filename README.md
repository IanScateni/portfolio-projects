# 🚀 Technical Portfolio

This repository gathers my **professional and personal projects** developed throughout my journey to become a **Full Stack Architect**.  
Each project here follows clean code practices, architectural principles, and includes working deployments when applicable.

🎯 Every project has been carefully selected based on its technical value, alignment with the `Architect Track` roadmap, and ability to demonstrate advanced engineering skills.
